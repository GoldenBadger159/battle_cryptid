                <h1>Creating a Character</h1>
                <p>The first step in writing any story is getting together a cast of characters. 
                    In Battle Cryptid this process is done by creating a character, which will be who 
                    you role play as throughout the different campaigns and adventures your GM will throw at you.
                </p>
                <p>Creating a character will start by determining what type of person you want to role play as. 
                    It may be advantageous to speak with your GM about the campaign before doing this as the general 
                    theme of the campaign can influence what type of person you may want to play.
                </p>
                <h2>Levels</h2>
                <p>Generally, a new character will start at level 1 and will progress through the levels as play continues. 
                    Consult with your GM what level you should build your character at if you are unsure. 
                    As you level up you will gain skill points and will progress through your class, spell schools, and trainings.
                </p>
                <h2>Hit Points and Hit Dice</h2>
                <p>Your Hit Points, or HP, is a measure of how much damage you can take before you are incapacitated. 
                    This number is determined by your Hit Dice, which can be found under your class description, combined with your Constitution modifier.
                </p>
                <p>At 1st level, rather than roll the dice to determine your HP, take the highest possible roll. So, a level 1 Abjurer, 
                    whose Hit Dice is 1d6 (one 6-sided die), and a constitution modifier of 2 would start with 8 HP. No matter how good 
                    the healing a character cannot exceed their maximum HP. Additionally, when a player reaches 0 HP they are not dead but unconscious.
                </p>
                <h2>Your Race</h2>
                <p>Choosing a race is one of the most important steps in defining who your character is as it represents the culture your character 
                    was likely to be raised in, their natural tendencies, and their heritage. You'll find 20 available races to choose from when creating a character,
                    providing diverse options for your subsequent characters.
                </p>
                <p>Your choice of race will likely be influenced by which class you wish to play. Keep this and mind and as you make your decisions. 
                    It may be beneficial to read through the descriptions and abilities of both your race and class before deciding on either.
                     Do not take this to mean that any one race can only match up with specific classes, as your options are meant to be just that;
                     yours. Any combination can work together, just be aware that some may collaborate better than others. 
                </p>
                <h2>Your Class</h2>
                <p>Your class is what provides you, the player, with the abilities, skills, 
                    and advantages you will use to play your part in telling the collective story that a campaign is meant to be. 
                </p>
                <p>More than just being a list of things you can do as a player, a class should provide the player with 
                    a means by which to understand who their character is. It defines the path they walk and should provide 
                    inspiration for writing which paths they have walked in the past, where they have been, what training they’ve 
                    had and who taught it to them, their attitude towards life, and so much more. Because of the important nature 
                    of how a class may help you define who you are playing as, this is one of the most important choices. 
                    Don’t worry too much about picking the perfect one, as no player should ever be limited to only ever playing one character. 
                </p>
                <h2>Your Backstory</h2>
                <p>“It is through our pasts that our future is defined, as our pasts define each of us, who we were, and therefore who we have the capacity to become” 
                    – Someone smart, sometime in history, probably. Writing your character’s backstory – and then giving this to your GM – 
                    is perhaps the most important step in preparing for a campaign. 
                </p>
                <p>Through your choices of race, class, and whatever fun things you wish to include, there should be ample inspiration to come 
                    up with a story of how you got where you are at the beginning of your campaign. GMs should provide their players with a brief 
                    description of what factors will be necessary for your party to have come together. (i.e. telling the players that the party 
                    will all be in a certain bar at a certain time or are all a part of a certain adventurer’s guild.) This should provide a point 
                    of reference and will allow your players to use their class and race to plot a second point on the graph of their lives, 
                    helping them draw the line that is their story.
                </p>
                <p>Collaboration and communication between GM and player is necessary and advantageous to the overall story if you desire to have a fun, 
                    cohesive, and meaningful campaign. GMs, make use of your player’s backstories.
