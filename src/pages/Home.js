                    <h1>About BC</h1>
                    <p>Battle Cryptid is a Table Top Role Playing Game (TTRPG) created to offer a different cast of races, classes, 
                        and monsters than your traditional fantasy setting. By using influences from many different real world cultures, 
                        the world of Puter was born, combining the aspects and mythologies into one dynamic ecosystem. Battle cryptid 
                        distinguishes itself from other TTRPGs, like DnD, by putting a focus on the players ability to interact with the 
                        elements, people, and lore in the world of Puter. Class skills and spells shift from, "I do this and get this result", 
                        to "By combining the effects of these several things my enemies are affected this way".
