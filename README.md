# Web Pages

At this point there are a few major pages. The login and signup pages whose function is self explanitory,
The Home page which acts as a navigation hub and base overview for the entire website.
And the character creation page where users can create their characters. I navigate between these pages using 
the react router dom and a navbar in the header.
